# **App Name**: ClassVote

## Core Features:

- Vote Initiation: Enable any user to initiate a vote for a specific class, requiring an attendance number to start the vote.
- Visibility Control: Allow the vote creator to select visibility settings regarding who can see individual votes (everyone, vote admin only, or no one).
- Attendance-based Voting: Implement a voting interface where students can enter their attendance number and cast their vote.
- Versatile Voting Options: The application should allow free-form text submissions, multiple choice options, or a simple "yes/no" or "agree/disagree" format for votes.
- Manual Vote Closure: The admin should be able to end the vote via button press.
- Unvoted Tracking: Track and display which students have not yet voted, visible only to the vote administrator.
- No input history: Ensure that no input history is saved on the device, to allow for multiple students to vote on the same device.
- Dark/Light Theme Switching: The application supports both dark and light themes, toggleable by the user.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid blue (#29ABE2) to convey trust and modernity.
- Background color: Light blue (#E5F5FF), nearly desaturated, for a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Bright orange (#FF9933) for call-to-action buttons, providing contrast and guiding user interaction.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for a clean and modern user interface.
- The layout should be clean and intuitive, focusing on ease of navigation. Use a card-based design to present options clearly. The main voting interface should be accessible and straightforward.
- Use simple, outlined icons from a set like Feather or simple line icons, ensuring they are consistent and easily recognizable. Icons should primarily support navigation.
- Subtle transitions when opening or closing voting options, coupled with feedback animations when a vote is submitted. This ensures the interaction feels dynamic but not distracting.
